Click on the one that looks like the one you want and read the specific documentation regarding that particular Callback. For the purposes of this example, we're going to link our Nagios XI instance to a custom javascript file using the <code>CALLBACK_PAGE_HEAD</code> Callback.": "",

    "Development of Nagios XI components is outside of the scope of this document, so we'll be making the assumption that you have at least a basic working knowledge of creating and testing custom components. We're going to create a component entirely from scratch, so we need to come up with a name. We'll use nagiosxicallbacks. Create a directory in <strong>/usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/</strong> called <strong>nagiosxicallbacks</strong>.": "",

    "We defined a pretty basic component, and made sure to call the component initialize function.

The <code>$callback_type</code> variable contains a value that corresponds directly to the Callback that is being executed - in this case it would be <code>CALLBACK_PAGE_HEAD</code>. The <code>$callback_args</code> variable can contain different data for each Callback type; check each Callback's specific reference for passed values. In this particular case, the only argument thats passed is <code>$callback_args[\"child\"]</code> - a boolean value representing whether this is a child page or not. As you can see, our code checks for both: the right <code>$callback_type</code>, and to make sure we're only including the javascript when <code>$callback_args[\"child\"]</code> is true (this means that its the page displayed in the main content frame).": "",
